    <div class="content">
      <p>Happy Wednesday / Thursday morning everybody!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the Flarnchain newsletter, delivered to your inbox <i>each and every week</i> <b><i>like an atomic clock</i></b>. In this edition, we'll be covering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An animated market animal</li>
        <li>Another update about the newsletter, last week was actually a failure!</li>
        <li>And probably not much more... these last couple of weeks have been building phases, and not much time to write.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So let's get right into it, shall we?</p>
      <p></p>

      <H3>Market Update / Weekly Chart</H3>
        <p>The crypto markets were <b>down very bad</b> this week. Like seriously not a great week for crypto. I saw some rumblings that this was caused by a selloff that happened due to some sort of rumor that Tesla had sold all of its Bitcoin, and like $1 billion worth of leveraged long positions got liquidated as a result. Or maybe the crypto market selloff was caused by the bankruptcy filing by the Chinese real estate behemoth Evergrande. Nobody can say for sure, but take one look at the chart and it's pretty obvious that things weren't great these past two weeks.</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/weekly_chart/133.png?raw=true" alt="The weekly chart" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">The entire market is down ~ 6-7% this week. Bitcoin really took a beating, down almost 8%. Also, if you look at the chart for ATOM it's quite literally <i>off the charts.</i></div> 
          
          <p>I would like to spend some more time explaining or researching certain market dynamics, as that is something I particularly enjoy and haven't really done much of in the past few weeks (maybe even the past few months to be honest), but this is just something that comes and goes. As my primary time focus for the Flarnchain Newsletter has been to rebuild the entire back-end, I'm not able to dedicate as much time to the actual content itself. That said, I think this week's market animal is pretty neat.</p>

        <h3>Market Animal</h3>
          <p>Let's check out this week's market animal! Just like last week, this week's market animal is a <b>BEAR</b>! And an animated bear at that. This particular animation is a 26 frame long frame-by-frame animation that I created in the animation and pixel art software Aesprite. It's a really cool program, and I'm finally beginning to understand how to use some of the features after a few months of playing with it here and there. Hoping to really level up my art and animation game in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/bearanimation.gif?raw=true" alt="The weekly chart" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">I spent about 20 minutes too long drawing this bear.</div>
          <p>So, markets are down, we are back in a bear market, and I drew a <i>dang good bear... but at what cost?</i> If you haven't noticed, this week's newsletter is formatted a bit differently as compared to the prior 131 newsletters that came before it.</p>
        
        <h3>Flarnchain Newsletter Facelift!</h3>
          <p>That's right. The newsletter got a facelift. I wrote a whole bunch of Python scripts and wired them all together so that I can send emails though g-mail from the Command Line Interface on any computer. Since all of the media files need to be stored in a content delivery service to send the emails, I now can write the newsletter from anywhere, on any device, so long as I have access to the internet.</p>
          
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/tree.png?raw=true" alt="Project Directory Tree" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Here's a screenshot of my project directory tree. I spent way too much time agonizing about how to organize the files... That I never accomplished anything. This oranization is <i>most definitely not the best</i>, but I'm trying to learn to not let <b>perfect</b> be the enemy of <b>good enough</b></div>

          <p>I also get to benefit from the automation benefits that come from having a back-end database that stores email addresses, rather than just keeping the subscriber list in an excel spreadsheet. This may not seem like a lot, or kind of pointless, as I could have just used a service like Survey Monkey to do all of this for me, but I really wanted to make sure that I understand as much of the tech stack as possible that is used by the Flarnchain ecosystem. The more knowledge I have about the interworkings of content delivery on the internet, the better I will be prepared to grasp those concepts as they relate building the Flarnchain blockchain itself.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/newsletter-sender-code.png?raw=true" alt="some Python for sending an email" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Here's a screenshot of the main chunk of code that actually sends the newsletter out. There's some improvements that I can make to this which would make the process of sending more streamlined, but for now, I'm pleased with what I've built.</div>

          <p>So not only have I learned a lot through the process of building this, but I'm also gradually building out the infrastructure that will be used for bigger and better things to come. I'm really excited and happy with this accomplishment.</p>

          <p>That's all for tonight. I didn't really get to spend a lot of time writing the newsletter itself, but this is my first time doing it this way. Once I get the hang of things, I truly think I'll be upping my game. Now that I have the basic template set up, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Any glitches? Recommendations on colors? Font too big / too small? Let me know and <i>Stay tuned for more!</i></p>
      

      <p>Thanks for reading, and we'll see you next week!</p>
      <p>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
