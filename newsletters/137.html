      <p>Happy Wednesday / Thursday morning everybody!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the Flarnchain newsletter, delivered to your inbox <i>each and every week</i> <b><i>like an atomic clock</i></b>. In this edition, we'll be covering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A fresh market animal, bull market appears to be back, at least for a little while üêÇ</li>
        <li>Some thoughts on the Akash blockchain</li>
        <li>Quck update on development of the Flarnchain Ecosystem</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's get started with a short conversation on the crypto markets</p>
      <p></p>

      <H3>Market Update / Weekly Chart</H3>
        <p>This week saw a bit of a reversal of the previous bear/crab trend we have been seening the past few weeks. This week, the crypto market bounced above $1.1 trillion, perhaps on positive news about the Bitcoin ETF, perhaps on some <i>lukewarm news</i> about interest rates. Either way, things are trending up a bit, which is always kind of exciting.</p>

          <div class="caption">a chart depicting the price of Bitcoin, and the % change of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos Hub since February 8, 2023</div> 
          
          <p>As you can see from the weekly chart, things are looking not so bad right now. Looks like a bounce, or even a bit of a reversal before the entire market dipped below $1 trillion. Also, if you zoom in reeeeal far, you might see that my favorite crypto asset, Cosmos Hub, is back on the chart.</p>

          <div class="caption">A zoomed in chart depicting Cosmos Hub peaking above the bottom border of the weekly chart</div>

          <p>Perhaps we need to take a closer look at that, I can barely see if that little spec is actually rising above the bottom border</p>

          <div class="caption">A much more zoomed in chart, showing Cosmos Hub $ATOM.</div>

          <p>And there's a flarncoin pointing at it. I'm excited for when we are deep into phase 2 of the flarnmap, and I'll be able to chart the price of Flarncoin alongside my three favorite cryptocurrencies. I'll need to probably make a sacrifice on either the left or right axis, since Flarncoin is likely to be significantly less than a penny in the early days.</p>

        <h3>Market Animal</h3>
          <p>As noted above, this week ushers in a new market animal. This week's market animal is a <b>BULL!</b> We haven't seen a bull market in... *checks notes* 13 weeks! Not since June 21st, in Flarnchain Newsletter 124 did we see a bull market animal!</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/market_animals/137.jpg?raw=true" alt="a bull" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">a marker drawing of a bull with an ink outline</div>
          <p>This week I drew this bull in my notebook, and then just took a picture with my phone. Uploaded it to twitter, or i guess "x", and then downloaded it straight to the `flarnchain-newsletter` repo. pretty fast workflow, but resulted in a JPEG instead of a PNG file. I'm more of a fan of PNGs as they tend to be smaller and easier to work with, but I think this is a much faster workflow. If next week is also a bull market, I'll properly digitize this baby bull. I'm also dabbling with the idea of making these market animals a growing collection of NFTs, since that would be a great way to practice interacting with blockchains again.</p>
        
        <h3>The Akash Network</h3>

          <h4>The Akash Blockchain</h4>
          <p>Akash is a blockchain that is connected to the Cosmos Network. Last week, to dip our toes into the idea of "what is a blockchain", I walked us through the basic concept of a "chain of blocks" of data. A blockchain is a type of data structure that chains together blocks of data. By itself, that's really not that interesting. But combined with the internet, and a robust *consensus engine*, a blockchain becomes something entirely different. It becomes a thing that *exists* on the internet and *has value*, even if a tiny bit.</p>

          <p>Sometimes blockchains have a lot of value. Like Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain *has value* and that value could be measured in many ways. One of the ways to measure the value of any *thing that has value* is by looking at it's **Market Capitalization**. The **Market Capitalization** or *market cap* for short of any *thing that has value* is calculated by multiplying the total number of units of **the thing** (it's **Circulating Supply**) by the **Market Price** of one of the units.</p>

          
          <p>For example, right now the **Circulating Supply** of Bitcoin is 19,491,568, and its market price is $27,058.95 (this is as of 9:33pm central time, on September 20, 2023). That means that the **Market Capitalization of Bitcoin** is around $527 million dollars, or roughly **Half A Trillion Dollars**.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/btc_mkt_cap.png?raw=true" alt="mathematical equation of btc market cap" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Here's some math</div>

          <p>Interestingly enough, while these concepts are fairly well known for your average crypto enthusiast in a bear market, people who get into crypto during bull markets might not actually be knowledgeable about these concepts, and these are incredibly important concepts when it comes to understanding cryptocurrencies, since they ***are*** money.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/akt_card.png?raw=true" alt="a card from coingecko of Akash network dated sep 20, 2023" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Each column is a phase, each block is a year, inside each block is every single Wednesday formatted like this: mm/dd/yy</div>

            
          <p>A quick glance at the Akash "overview" card on Coingecko.com shows us that the Akash Network has a market capitalization ofabout $188 million, and is rank #159 on Coingecko's market capitalization rankings. It's pretty big, but it's not huge. That's kind of a sweet spot, so long as the project is using crypto for the right reason, and solving a real problem. So, does it do that?</p>

          <h4>What does Akash do?</h4>

          <p>First we need to sort of distinguish what Akash is again. It's a blockchain, but it's also the native cryptocurrency of the Akash blockchain. A *native cryptocurrency* is one that comes from it's own chain. These are commonly described as **coins** rather than **tokens**. Other good examples of native crypto currencies include **Bitcoin** (BTC) and **Ether** (ETH).  </p>

          <p>Akash has a bunch of services that it offers it's users. The first and most simple of it's services is that it is a cryptocurrency with several attributes that I personally find interesting:</p>

          <ol>It is the native coin of a sovereign blockchain.</ol>
          <ol>It offers staking rewards to delegators.</ol>
          <ol>It lives on the cosmos network, thus has a lot of *interoperability* with other blockchains.</ol>

          <p>Because of these features, I'm already pretty interested in it. But, turns out, thanks to a Software Development Kit called the Cosmos SDK, lots of cryptocurrencies exist that meet the three criteria above. Not all of them have interesting use cases.</p>

          <p>*Akash is different* in that regard. It actually does something pretty interesting. Well, it it's native coin can be used to *pay for something* pretty interesting. The coin's primary use on the blockchain, besides security for the network itself, is to pay for cloud computing services.</p>

          <p>This sort of setup means that one can use Akash to use a much different type of internet. One that has a totally different type of security mechanism and one that I find very interesting. It's kind of hard to explain, but basically... Akash allows people to use the internet on a completely different type of infrastructure. The only thing I can think of as an analogy to explain this is like... actually all of the analogies I just thought of don't make a whole lot of sense. I'm going to have to come back to this...</p>
        
        <h3>The Rest of the Flarnchain Newsletter</h3>
          <p>Okay I probably rambled on for a bit too long there. As always, trying to tighten up my writing, but still have some fun with this. If you made it this far, here's a quick development update on the Flarnchain ecosystem...</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/flarnmaps/137.png?raw=true" alt="The Flarnmap, as of Sep 20, 2023" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Each column is a phase, each block is a year, inside each block is every single Wednesday formatted like this: mm/dd/yy</div>

          <p>Not much of an update. I'm currently buried under a mountain of work in the fiat mines, so I haven't had much time to build, but I did recently start drawing lots and lots of pictures of towers in a notebook, and I've been dabbling a bit with *preprocessing* and *edge detection algorithms* which are just fancy ways of saying:</p>

          <blockquote>I've been asking GPT-4 how to write preprocessing and edge detection algorithms in Python.</blockquote>

          <p>Anyways, it's been a lot of fun. I've been making a lot of these drawings with my daughter, as she is starting to enjoy drawing and always wants to draw with me when I get my pens out.</p>

          <p>Here's a few examples:</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/towers.png?raw=true" alt="a bunch of drawings of towers" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">I drew these in pen, and then ran this page through a preprocessing algorithm. </div>

          <p>I would like to develop a pipeline that properly edge-detects each of the images of a tower, and extracts and formats that image into something like a 1080x1080 pixel png, and also generates a sigil, a dashbaord of the contents, and a JSON object from that tower so I can turn the entire collection of drawings into an NFT collection. The first step is just enjoying my time making drawings of towers, I think this is one of my favorite subjects to draw.</p>

        <p>Alright, that's it for tonight. Hope you enjoyed reading the newsletter!</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading, and we'll see you next week!</p>
      <p>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
