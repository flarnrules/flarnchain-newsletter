    <div class="content">
      <p>Happy Wednesday / Thursday morning everybody!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the Flarnchain newsletter, delivered to your inbox <i>each and every week</i> <b><i>like an atomic clock</i></b>. In this edition, we'll be covering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The state of the crypto bear market</li>
        <li>A short explanation of the built in supply reduction in the Bitcoin protocol</li>
        <li>A status update on Flarnchain development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's get started with a short conversation on the crypto markets</p>
      <p></p>

      <H3>Market Update / Weekly Chart</H3>
        <p>This week, the crypto markets continued to drop. In fact the total market capitalization dropped by over 4% this week, and we have seen several weeks of decline. Despite  some interesting and promising news on the topic of Bitcoin etfs and other investment opportunities for instituational investment in crypto assets, the crypto markets have continued to languish in a state commonly referred to as "goblin town" by crypto enthusiasts. Things probably won't turn around any time in the near short term, but my prediction is that things will start to turn around a bit as we get closer to an important event that occurs once every 4 years "the Bitcoin halving".</p>

          <div class="caption">a chart depicting the price of Bitcoin, and the % change of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos Hub since February 8, 2023</div> 
          
          <p>As we can see by the chart above, my estimate suggests that we are around 200 days away from the next Bitcoin halving. We can also see from the chart that as traditional markets, including institutional and retail investors have lost interest in the crypto markets, the smaller assets like Ethereum (ETH, purple line) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM, blue line) have been disproportionately impacted as compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the largest market capitalization of all crypto currencies, and this capitalization has seemingly had some impact on it's price stability. It is the reason why I believe that the entire crypto ecosystem is dependent on the success of Bitcoin as a financial investement in order to thrive. If Bitcoin continues to drop, so too does the rest of the market.</p>

        <h3>Market Animal</h3>
          <p>This week, the crypto market continued to drop. We are currently in the 4th straight bear week. I don't anticipate this changing any time soon.</p>

        <h3>The Bitcoin Protocol</h3>
          <p>Let's take a moment to revisit a concept I breifly touched on near the beginning of this newsletter. The Bitcoin protocol. I don't think it's a good idea to get deep in the weeds of the Bitcoin protocol, that can be reserved for future newsletters. Let's just keep things simple. The Bitcoin protocol is the set of rules that governs how Bitcoin works. These rules are hard to change dramatically. The protocol is tweaked occasionally with software upgrades called "hard forks" and "soft forks" but the major components of the protocol remain unchanged Bitcoin's genesis block way back in 2009. The process by which Bitcoin is chainged is a fascinating topic, but oustide the scope of tonight's newsletter.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/btc_address.png?raw=true" alt="A picture of Bitcoin" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">This is a Bitcoin. It is "saying" a Bitcoin wallet address.</div>

          <p>There are basically two "pillars" in the Bitcoin protocol that are important to get started thinking about Bitcoin.
            <ol><b>1 A capped supply of 21 million Bitcoins</b> meaning that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be "mined" by Bitcoin miners</ol>
            <ol><b>2 A halving event that occurs once every roughly 4 years</b> meaning that every 4 years, 50% fewer Bitcoins are "mined" each time a new Bitcoin block is created, which each block is created roughly once every 10 minutes</ol>
          </p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/btc_final_form.png?raw=true" alt="A picture of Bitcoin standing on the sun, holding the earth" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">In this image, Bitcoin is indicating that it has not reached it's final form.</div>

          <p>Pillar #2 above is super important, as it has dictated the way the crypto markets have ebbed and flowed since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. If we think about a Bitcoin halving event in simple terms of supply and demand... this makes perfect sense. All things held equal, if the new supply of Bitcoin every 10 minutes is cut in half, but demand for Bitcoin remains the same, then the price of Bitcoin will increase. Now, many people are aware of this concept, and thus plan accordingly and act to front run this essential element of the Bitcoin protocol. But, not everyone does this sort of front running, because not everyone is even aware of the halving event. Each cycle (that is the 4 year Bitcoin halving cycle) the impact that this event has on the price of Bitcoin diminishes. This will be the 4th such cycle, and my prediction is that it will still have a noticable increase in the price of Bitcoin resulting in anywhere from a 100% increase to a 200% increase in the price of Bitcoin in the days leading up to the halving.</p>

          <p>If the macro economic conditions are ripe for a sort of "risk on" investing environment, this could result in a cascading effect of first institutional buyers, and then retail buyers piling on and trying to buy Bitcoin when the supply of newly minted Bitcoins has been recently halved. Miners will want to hold some of their Bitcoins if the price is rising, resulting in even more supply strain, and creating a virtious feedback loop causing massive price action to the upside. This has happened several times in the past, and there's no indication that it won't happen again. The new capital that floods into the markets will propel other, much smaller crypto assets up by much larger multiples, which is where both the largest amount of risk resides, and the largest amount of upside potential.If true, my prediction is that this will then kick off a period of intense speculation and another rip-roaring crypto bull market.</p>

          <p>If the halving even kicks off another bull market, and another cambrian explosion of innovation and wealth generation in the crypto ecosystem, I intend to capitalize heavily on this event, but I also have learned lessons from the past. The vast majority of the potential gains in the next bull market will <i>not be sustainable</i> and holding an asset that has gone up by 100% or in some cases 1,000% in a short period of time is a recipe for disaster. Thus, I'm currently formulating a plan that will methodically enter into, and exit out of, winning positions if this bull market materializes.</p>

        <h3>Flarnchain Update</h3>
          <p>I'm going to start doing more frequent updates regarding my development progress on the Flarnchain blockchain. It's possible, but highly unlikely, that many of the readers are even aware that I have a much larger goal beyond merely cluttering the Flarnchain readership's inbox with a weekly email about random tech stuff. I'm actually developing the skills necessary to develop a fully functioning and self-sustaining decentralized blockchain network called Flarnchain. This newsletter is one of many components necessary for this to happen. I set out to build and deploy this network back at the very start of this newsletter, in early 2021, and I am happy to say that I am currently on target.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/flarnmaps/135.png?raw=true" alt="The Flarnmap, as of Sep 6, 2023" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Each column is a phase, each block is a year, inside each block is every single Wednesday formatted like this: mm/dd/yy</div>

          <p>When I started this newsletter, I created a high-level 12 year plan for the Flarnchain blockchain, which I've been referring to as the "flarnmap". I haven't shown the flarnmap in a newsletter for quite some time. It's displayed somewhere on the website that I haven't maintained in several months. Rather than mention the flarnmap occasionally and at random, I think it's a good idea to start providing development updates each and every week, so that those of you who are insteresting in learning about how to be a participant in the network will have a clear undersatnding of where I'd like the network to go. <i>Note, the flarnmap represents an enthusiatic and optimistic set of <b>goals</b>, and in no way does it represent any sort of garuntee.</i> That said, it is currently a goal that is well on it's way to completion due to the nature of the flarnmap.</p>

          <h4>Phases</h4>
          <p>The flarnmap is broken into 4 phases, each phase is 3 years long:
            <ol><b>Phase 1 - DISCOVERY</b> Years 1-3 ~ this phase represents a period of learning and discovering the world of digital assets, blockchains, distributed ledgers, cryptocurrencies and the like. We are near the end of phase 1, and I've spent the past 2.5 years really immersing myself in the entire crypto ecosysystem, finding things that I like and strongly dislike about crypto.</ol>

            <ol><b>Phase 2 - IMPLEMENTATION</b> Years 4-6 ~ this phase represents a period of deployment. Deploying digital assets associated with the Flarnchain ecosystem on other already existing blockchains will mostly occur in years 4 and 5, while deploying the actual sovereign Flarnchain blockchain will mostly likely occur in year 6. I've already deployed <i>some</i> digital assets that are elements of the Flarnchain ecosystem on the Wax blockchain called "Flarn Cards". These are NFTs that will eventually hold 100,000 Flarncoins each, and will be one of the many mechanisms that generate and release Flarncoins into circulation in the greater crypto ecosystem.</ol>

            <ol><b>Phase 3 - MASS ADOPTION</b> Years 7-9 ~ this phase is a continuation of the implementation phase, and will represent a period of significant growth and development of the blockchain. Mass adoption will require a significant amount of attractive features that make people want to hold Flarncoins, use Flarncoins, and participate in the digital space that is the Flarnchain blockchain. The primary focus of the blockchain will be liesure (think online video game / digital world / metaverse stuff) but with the appropriate infrastructure the opportunities are endless.</ol>

            <ol><b>Phase 4 - WORLD DOMINATION</b> Years 10-12 ~ this is the final phase of this version of the Flarnmap. New phases can be added after year 12 if the stated goal of a $1 billion market capitalization is achieved. The World Domination phase is simply a continuation of the Mass Adoption phase. More features, more users, more everything.</ol>
