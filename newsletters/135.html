      <p>Happy Wednesday / Thursday morning everybody!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the Flarnchain newsletter, delivered to your inbox <i>each and every week</i> <b><i>like an atomic clock</i></b>. In this edition, we'll be covering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A more better animated market animal (compared to last week)</li>
        <li>A sort of tutorial explaining domain names</li>
        <li>A discussion of a <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23850498/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-lawsuit-wins-sec>court win</a> by grayscale against the SEC regarding Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's get started with a short conversation on the crypto markets</p>
      <p></p>

      <H3>Market Update / Weekly Chart</H3>
        <p>This week, the crypto markets were pretty weird. They were down pretty bad at the beginning, off the heels of a 10%+ drop in the market price of just about everything in crypto. Pretty "crypto-y" behavior for the market, but still a 10% change in the price of an asset will never not be jarring. All that said, this week the crypto market shot up rapidly (actually this happened yesterday) due to some good news for a large player in the crypto industry Grayscale. So anyways, it's been a mixed bag. It's also important to note that the "big increase" looks a lot less extreme when viewed at a distance:</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/weekly_chart/134.png?raw=true" alt="The weekly chart" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Sure, the market is up 5-10% this week, but look at how that looks on the chart? Actually, now that I'm really looking at this weekly chart, I think there are a few ways I could improve it for better readability. First, I think this chart would work better as 2 charts. I'm trying to cram way too much information on one screen. I'm going to work on this next week and come up with a better way to look at the % change chart and the Bitcoin chart simultaneously, but in a way that is hopefully less visually noisy.</div> 
          
          <p>If we look at the current cumulative change for this year, we can see that Bitcoin is still up almost 20%... which is quite a lot when considering that the typical returns that investors are seeking are in that sweet spot of 6-8% every single year. a 20% year is like 3 years worth of traditional finance gains. Now you would have needed to buy Bitcoin at exactly the right date, and then sell all of your Bitcoin... I guess today to make that type of gain, but still. It's crazy to think that 20% up on the year is considered poor returns. Then again, holding an asset like Bitcoin carries massive risk, so in that context it absolutely makes sense. High risk - high reward baby!</p>

        <h3>Market Animal</h3>
          <p>Let's check out this week's market animal! Just the past two weeks, this week's market animal is a bear. And just like last week, this week we can see an animated bear. I added a bit more detail to the bear, and this time the bear is breathing smoke, instead of fire. Why smoke? because the market is up a bit... I dunno. It made sense at the time.</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/bearanimation-smoke.gif?raw=true" alt="A smoke breathing bear" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Smoke is less than fire. Thus this bear market is.. less bear??? than last week.</div>
          <p>Last week I asked "is this the start of another prolonged bear market?" well, if the answer to that question was a resounding yes, the fire coming out of this week's bear's mouth would have been epic. But instead, it seems we are just going to putter along at around $1 to $1.1 trillion dollar crypto market capitalization for who knows how long. Probably another year or so (probably more like 200 days more, if the Bitcoin halving has anything to do with it)</p>
        
        <h3>The start of my journey to self-hosting this newsletter</h3>
          <p>The more I try to figure out how to automate the process of sending this newsletter to a larger audience, the more I realize that I'm either stuck paying for a service, or building something a lot more complex than I am capable of doing with my current set of skills. I basically have three choices:
          <ul>Learn something new</ul>
          <ul>Pay for a service</ul>
          <ul>Do both!</ul>
          </p>

          <p>In case you haven't guessed it yet, I've decided on the third option "do both". In that spirit, I'm researching basically everything there is to research regarding email. We are talking stuff like SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol), DNS (domain name system), SPF (sender policy framework), DKIM (domainkeys identified mail standard), DMARC (domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance) and whole bunch of other stuff.</p>

          <p>Why am I doing this? Because I want to understand the underlying tools that we use every day to transfer information. If I don't understand that basic infrastructure, how the heck am I to truly understand the future of financial infrastructure? The backbone of all of this stuff is the Internet, so if I don't really understand how stuff on the internet works, then I probably shouldn't be playing around with financial rails. Haha, just kidding. You don't need to know how the engine of a car works to drive a car... then again. With Flarnchain, I'm not trying to use a blockchain... I'm trying to build one.</p>
            
        <p>Dang I'm realizing it's starting to get late, and I'd really like to send this out before Wednesday ends, so I'll just cut this one short... again. I think if in the future I'm able to get into the habit of writing some articles throughout the week, then I could just insert them directly into the newsletter, so Wednesday night I'm just assembling it, rather than writing the whole daggone thing. Thing is... it takes a while to write this because I'm trying to juggle a whole bunch of concepts at once, but I try to do it all in one night. That significantly degrades the quality and likely makes the e-mail a lot less interesting.</p>
          
        <p>Okay that's all for tonight.</p>
      

      <p>Thanks for reading, and we'll see you next week!</p>
      <p>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
