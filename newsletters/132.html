    <div class="content">
      <p>Happy Wednesday / Thursday morning everybody!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the Flarnchain newsletter, delivered to your inbox <i>each and every week</i> <b><i>like an atomic clock</i></b>. In this edition, we'll be covering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All the usual stuff such as the weekly chart and market animal.</li>
        <li>An update about this newsletter (notice anything different?)</li>
        <li>And yeah, that's all, because just figuring out how to do this took a lot of time and effort.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So let's get right into it, shall we?</p>
      <p></p>
      <div class="ascii-graphic"> ~/~|~\~|~/~\~/~|~\~|~/~\~/~|~\~|~/~\~</div>

      <H3>Market Update / Weekly Chart</H1>
        <p>The crypto markets were in rough shape this week. As you can see from the weekly chart, crypto is down. I'm not going to write much more than this, because I'm writing this newsletter directly in my test editor in native HTML, which is a strange sensation and not at all as enjoyable as writing with a word processor, in an email client, or really any other way of writing.</p>

          <div class="caption">As we can see from the weekly chart... crypto is down.</div> 
          
          <p>I don't have enough time tonight to explain why, and to be honest, nobody ever knows these things for sure. For me, an important aspect of investing has been to just sort of... keep track for a while and get a sense of what's happening. I'm not trying to catch big swings up or down. Rather, I'm just trying to make sure I'm ready to ride those big waves and remember to take some profits when things seem too good to be true.</p>
        <h3>Market Animal</h3>
          <p>Let's check out this week's market animal. If you haven't guessed it yet, this week's market animal is a <b>BEAR</b>!</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/bear.png?raw=true" alt="The weekly chart" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">I spent about 20 minutes too long drawing this bear.</div>
          <p>So, markets are down, we are back in a bear market, and I drew a <i>dang good bear... but at what cost?</i> If you haven't noticed, this week's newsletter is formatted a bit differently as compared to the prior 131 newsletters that came before it.</p>
        
        <h3>Flarnchain Newsletter Facelift!</h3>
          <p>That's right. The newsletter got a facelift. I wrote a whole bunch of Python scripts and wired them all together so that I can send emails though g-mail from the Command Line Interface on any computer. Since all of the media files need to be stored in a content delivery service to send the emails, I now can write the newsletter from anywhere, on any device, so long as I have access to the internet.</p>
          
          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/tree.png?raw=true" alt="Project Directory Tree" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Here's a screenshot of my project directory tree. I spent way too much time agonizing about how to organize the files... That I never accomplished anything. This oranization is <i>most definitely not the best</i>, but I'm trying to learn to not let <b>perfect</b> be the enemy of <b>good enough</b></div>

          <p>I also get to benefit from the automation benefits that come from having a back-end database that stores email addresses, rather than just keeping the subscriber list in an excel spreadsheet. This may not seem like a lot, or kind of pointless, as I could have just used a service like Survey Monkey to do all of this for me, but I really wanted to make sure that I understand as much of the tech stack as possible that is used by the Flarnchain ecosystem. The more knowledge I have about the interworkings of content delivery on the internet, the better I will be prepared to grasp those concepts as they relate building the Flarnchain blockchain itself.</p>

          <img src="https://github.com/flarnrules/flarnchain-newsletter/blob/main/media/newsletter-sender-code.png?raw=true" alt="some Python for sending an email" class="picture"/>
          <div class="caption">Here's a screenshot of the main chunk of code that actually sends the newsletter out. There's some improvements that I can make to this which would make the process of sending more streamlined, but for now, I'm pleased with what I've built.</div>

          <p>So not only have I learned a lot through the process of building this, but I'm also gradually building out the infrastructure that will be used for bigger and better things to come. I'm really excited and happy with this accomplishment.</p>

          <p>That's all for tonight. I didn't really get to spend a lot of time writing the newsletter itself, but this is my first time doing it this way. Once I get the hang of things, I truly think I'll be upping my game. Now that I have the basic template set up, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Any glitches? Recommendations on colors? Font too big / too small? Let me know and <i>Stay tuned for more!</i></p>
      

      <p>Thanks for reading, and we'll see you next week!</p>
      <p>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
